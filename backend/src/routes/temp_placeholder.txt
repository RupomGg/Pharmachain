// Assuming 'auth.js' is the file, if list_dir calls show something else I will adjust. 
// But commonly it is auth.js or similar. I'll check list_dir output from next step before committing if I could, 
// but I am doing parallel. I'll rely on common naming or the list_dir output being shown in next turn.
// Actually, I can check list_dir output from Step 251. 
// "middleware" numChildren: 4. 
// I will blindly assumes 'authenticateToken' or 'protect' is exported from one of them.
// Let's use a dummy import or generic one and fix if needed. 
// Actually, `users.js` routes likely import it. I could have checked that.
// Let's list_dir first, then write this file in next turn to be Safe.
// NO due to parallel tool calls I can't wait. 
// I'll assume 'verifyToken' or similar from 'authMiddleware.js'.
// Let's wait for list_dir. 
// I will WRITe this file in the NEXT turn.
// Wait, I can't change the plan mid-stream in parallel execution unless I return.
// But I can verify logic. 
// I will SKIP writing orderRoutes.js in THIS turn and do it in NEXT turn after seeing `list_dir`.
// SafeToAutoRun is true for commands, but file writing is safe.
// I'll skip writing `orderRoutes.js` for now.
